<h1>Futbol for Kids</h1>

<p id="slogan">One soccer ball at a time</p>

<div id="hero">
<p>Futbol for Kids it’s our goal to deliver as many soccer balls to underprivileged kids as possible. No kid should be denied the chance to kick a ball about. It’s one of life’s most simple pleasures. Our goal is to increase our awareness and look for organizations that will provide us the necessary exposure to spread the work and aid us in collecting as many soccer balls as possible. For distribution of the soccer balls Futbol for Kids will both visit communities to deliver soccer balls directly but to also work with travel organizations, mission groups etc… and create a courier network that will allow soccer balls to be delivered worldwide.</p>
